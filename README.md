# Introduction 

Hello, I have created this github account to document my coding journey.

I have been introduced to coding this year (2024/25) but the courses were lacking and I want to learn more.
I began using the Mimo app and found it very intuative and I was retaining the information which previously had went over my head.

With this in mind I have decided to bite the bullet and complete the full course.
This repository will document my journey with Mimo and the projects it helps me to create.

I am hoping to achieve much more after building on my foundations with Mimo. I like the idea of creating more smaller projects first such as a calculator or a to do lists, and then something bigger like a website or applications.
