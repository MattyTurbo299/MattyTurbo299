Hello, I have created this github account to document my coding journey.

I have been introduced to coding this year but want to learn more,
I began using the Mimo app and found it very intuative and I was retaining the information which previously had went over my head.

With this in mind I have decided to bite th ebullet and complete the full course.
This repository will document my journey with Mimo and the projects it helps me to create.

I am hoping to achieve much more after building on my foundaitons with the ideaof creating more smaller projects from a calculator / to do lists,
tosomething bigger from a website to applicaitons.

More about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the Mimo course.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with hopes to learn other languages.
