# Introduction 

Hello, I have created this github account to document my coding journey.

I have been introduced to coding this year but the courses were lacking and I want to learn more.
I began using the Mimo app and found it very intuative and I was retaining the information which previously had went over my head.

With this in mind I have decided to bite the bullet and complete the full course.
This repository will document my journey with Mimo and the projects it helps me to create.

I am hoping to achieve much more after building on my foundations with the idea of creating more smaller projects from a calculator / to do lists,
to something bigger like a website and applications.

## Current Projects
