# Mimo Conversation (Project 1)

## What I Learned

This is my first project with Mimo.

Mimo has shown me how to use the following:
- Variables;
- True and False (Booleans);
- Formatting Strings;
- Comparing Numbers and Strings;
- Discovering Types and Comparisons;
- Learning how to allow the user to input and produce responses, producing a conversation.

## How this works

I created a code that askes the user questions such as:
- Name
- Age
- Favourite colour

It then compares the age of the bot and the user, referencing the difference between the two ages.
