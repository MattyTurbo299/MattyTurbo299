# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## What I learned 
This is my second project with Mimo.

It has helped me to learn the following:
- Flow Control
- Making Decisions
- Using Conditions / Conditional Statements
- Else Statements
- Incorporating Elif
- Complex Decisions
- Self-assigning and Operators
- While Loops and how to stop them
- For loops

## How this works
First the import random is needed to allow for a random outcome to be implemented. In this case it allows the computer to choose between the outputs at random.

Then a while statement is needed so we can create a gameplay loop of if, elif and else statements.

The first if statement decides the outcomes of the possible interactions. From the player or computer winning or the game ending in a tie. In this if statement it also adds to the win count of the compuiter or the player, once either reaches 2 the game is finished.

The next if statement says who won any individual round.

The final if statement then declares who has won the game.
