# Food Order System

## What I learned 
This is my fourth project with Mimo.

It has helped me to learn the following:
- How to reuse code with functions
- Creating Parameters
- Returning Values
- Using Multiples Parameters
- Functions and Variable Scope
- Deciding with Functions
- Functions with Lists
- Functions with Loops

## How this works
To begin we must create some menu items. We have two types of menu items. One is Italian and the other Inidan within these we create lists of the food the under these two menu's.

Now we define find mealand return the name if the name is in the menu list. Next we define the meal selection returning from italian food.
Below we define available meals using if elif and else statements for available italian meanl and available indian meals. Else will print invalid food type.
We next define a summary of the order saying you have ordered x or meal not found. 

Now we write the computers interaction with the user, we first print a welcome message and ask the user to input their choice of menu and then their choice of meal and how many meals they would like. The result of this is made into a variable and printed.
